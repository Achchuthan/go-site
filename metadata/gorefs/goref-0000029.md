title: Gene Ontology annotation based on information extracted from curated UniProtKB entries
year: 2001-2007
---

Method by which GO terms were manually assigned to UniProt KnowledgeBase accessions, using either a NAS or TAS evidence code, by applying information extracted from the corresponding publicly-available, manually curated UniProtKB entry. Such GO annotations were submitted by the GOA-UniProt group from 2001, but this annotation practice was discontinued in 2007.
