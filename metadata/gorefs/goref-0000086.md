title: Representation of cell differentiation as biological process in the Gene Ontology
year: 2013

We have created a standard template for classes describing the differentiation process for a cell type as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "GO:0030154 and 'results in acquisition of features of' some C", where C is a native cell (CL:0000003).
