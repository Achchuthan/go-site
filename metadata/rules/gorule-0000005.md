<p>
If we take an example annotation:
</p>
<div class="annot">
<p>
gene product: protein A<br>GO term: protein binding ; GO:0005515<br>evidence: IPI<br>reference: PMID:123456<br>with/from: <b>with</b> protein A
</p>
</div>
<p>
this annotation line can be interpreted as: protein A was found to carry out the 'protein binding' activity in PMID:12345, and that this function was <span class="evCode">Inferred from the results of a Physicial Interaction (IPI)</span> assay, which involved protein X
</p>
<p>
However if we would like to transfer this annotation to protein A's ortholog 'protein B', the <acronym title="Inferred from Sequence Similarity" class="evCode">ISS</acronym> annotation that would be created would be:
</p>
<div class="annot">
<p>
gene product: protein B<br>GO term: protein binding ; GO:0005515<br>evidence: ISS<br>reference: GO_REF:curator_judgement<br>with/from: <b>with</b> protein A
</p>
</div>
<p>
This is interpreted as 'it is inferred that protein B carries out protein binding activity due to its sequence similarity (curator determined) with protein A, which was experimentally shown to carry out 'protein binding'.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the <span class="evCode">ISS</span> annotation will not display the the interacting protein X accession. Such an annotation display can be confusing, as the value in the 'with' column just provides further information on why the <span class="evCode">ISS</span>/<span class="evCode">IPI</span> or <acronym title="Inferred from Genetic Interaction" class="evCode">IGI</acronym> annotation was created. This means that an <span class="evCode">ISS</span> projection from <span class="term">protein binding</span> is not particularly useful as you are only really telling the user that you think an homologous protein binds a protein, based on overall sequence similarity.
</p>
<p>
This rule only applies to GO:0005515, as descendant terms such as <span class="term">mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 binding ; GO:0048273</span> used as <span class="evCode">ISS</span> annotations are informative as the GO term name contains far more specific information as to the identity of the interactor.
