The IEP evidence code is used where process involvement is inferred from
the timing or location of expression of a gene, particularly when
comparing a gene that is not yet characterized with the timing or
location of expression of genes known to be involved in a particular
process. This type of annotation is only suitable with terms from the
Biological Process ontology.

For more information, see the [binding
guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines)
on the GO wiki.
