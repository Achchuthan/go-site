title: IEP usage is restricted to terms from the Biological Process ontology

<p>The <span class="evCode">IEP evidence code</span> is used where process involvement is inferred from the timing or location of expression of a gene, particularly when comparing a gene that is not yet characterized with the timing or location of expression of genes known to be involved in a particular process. This type of annotation is only suitable with terms from the Biological Process ontology.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines">binding guidelines</a> on the GO wiki.</p>
