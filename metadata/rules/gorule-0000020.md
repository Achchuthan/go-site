title: Automatic repair of annotations to merged or obsoleted terms
contact: "ramab@stanford.edu"

<p>
Ontology operations such as term merges and
obsoletions may be out of sync with annotation
releases. Each GO entry T in the GAF is checked to
see if it corresponds to a valid (non-obsolete) term
in the ontology. If not, metadata for other terms is
checked. If the term has been merged into a term S
(i.e. S has alt_id of T) then T is replaced by S in
the GAF line.
