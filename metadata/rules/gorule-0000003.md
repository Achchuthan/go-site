<p>Annotations to <span class="term">binding : GO:0005488</span> or <span class="term">protein binding ; GO:0005515</span> with the <acronym title="Traceable Author Statement" class="evCode">TAS</acronym>, <acronym title="Non-traceable Author Statement" class="evCode">NAS</acronym>, <acronym title="Inferred by Curator" class="evCode">IC</acronym>, <acronym title="Inferred from Mutant Phenotype" class="evCode">IMP</acronym>, <acronym title="Inferred from Genetic Interaction" class="evCode">IGI</acronym> and <acronym title="Inferred by Direct Assay" class="evCode">IDA</acronym> evidence codes are not informative as they do not allow the interacting  partner to be specified. If the nature of the binding partner is known (protein or DNA for example), an appropriate child term of <span class="term">binding ; GO:0005488</span> should be chosen for the annotation. In the case of chemicals, ChEBI IDs can go in the 'with' column. Children of <span class="term">protein binding ; GO:0005515</span> where the type of protein is identified in the GO term name do not need further specification.
