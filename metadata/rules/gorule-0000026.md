title: IBA evidence codes should be filtered from main MOD gaf sources

This seeks to filter out paint annotations that have leaked into the main mod GAF
sources. In this way, we only have these paint annotations coming directly from
paint.

If the GAF file being validated is not paint, and the line has evidence IBA,
then throw out that line.
