title: No 'NOT' annotations to 'protein binding ; GO:0005515'

<p>Even if an identifier is available in the 'with' column, a qualifier only informs on the GO term, it cannot instruct users to restrict the annotation to just the protein identified in the 'with', therefore an annotation applying <span class="term">protein binding ; GO:0005515</span> with the <span class="not">not</span> qualifier implies that the annotated protein cannot bind anything.</p>
<p>This is such a wide-reaching statement that few curators would want to make.</p>
<p>This rule <em>only</em> applies to GO:0005515; children of this term can be qualified with <span class="not">not</span>, as further information on the type of binding is then supplied in the GO term; e.g. <span class="not">not</span> + <span class="term">NFAT4 protein binding ; GO:0051529</span> would be fine, as the negative binding statement only applies to the NFAT4 protein.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines">binding guidelines</a> on the GO wiki.</p>
