title: IPI should not be used with catalytic activity molecular function terms

<p>The <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#ipi" class="evCode">IPI (Inferred from Physical Interaction) evidence code</a> is used where an annotation can be supported from interaction evidence between the gene product of interest and another molecule (see the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#ipi">evidence code documentation</a>). While the <span class="evCode">IPI evidence code</span> is frequently used to support annotations to terms that are children of <span class="term">binding ; GO:0005488</span>, it is thought unlikely by the Binding working group that enough information can be obtained from a binding interaction to support an annotation to a term that is a chid of <span class="term">catalytic activity ; GO:0003824</span>. Such <span class="evCode">IPI</span> annotations to child terms of <span class="term">catalytic activity ; GO:0003824</span> may need to be revisited and corrected.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotations_to_Catalytic_activity_with_IPI">catalytic activity annotation guide</a> on the GO wiki.</p>
