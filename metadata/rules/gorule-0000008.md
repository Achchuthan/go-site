title: No annotations should be made to uninformative high level terms
contact: "edimmer@ebi.ac.uk"
---

<p>Some terms are too high-level to provide useful information when used for annotation, regardless of the evidence code used.</p>
<p>We provide and maintain the list of too high-level terms as two subsets in the ontology:</p>
<ul>
<li>gocheck_do_not_annotate "Term not to be used for direct annotation"</li>
<li>gocheck_do_not_manually_annotate "Term not to be used for direct manual annotation"</li>
</ul>
<p>Both subsets denote high level terms, not to be used for any manual annotation.</p>
<p>For inferred electronic annotations (IEAs), we allow the use of terms from the 
gocheck_do_not_manually_annotate subset. These terms may still offer some general information, 
but a human curator should always be able to find a more specific annotation.</p>
