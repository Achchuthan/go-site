<p>The following basic checks ensure that submitted gene association files conform to the GAF spec, and come from the original GAF check script.</p>
<ul><li>Each line of the GAF file is checked for the correct number of columns, the cardinality of the columns, leading or trailing whitespace</li>
<li>Col 1 and all DB abbreviations must be in <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/xrefs.cgi">GO.xrf_abbs</a> (case may be incorrect)</li>
<li>All GO IDs must be extant in current ontology</li>
<li>Qualifier, evidence, aspect and DB object columns must be within the list of allowed values</li>
<li>DB:Reference, Taxon and GO ID columns are checked for minimal form</li>
<li>Date must be in YYYYMMDD format</li>
<li>All IEAs over a year old are removed</li>
<li>Taxa with a 'representative' group (e.g. MGI for Mus musculus, FlyBase for Drosophila) must be submitted by that group only</li>
</ul>
