The following basic checks ensure that submitted and parsed gene association files
conform to some GO specific specifications, and come from the original GAF check script.

-   All DB abbreviations must be in
    [GO.xrf\_abbs](http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/xrefs.cgi) (case
    may be incorrect)
-   All GO IDs must be extant in current ontology
-   Qualifier, evidence, aspect and DB object columns must be within the
    list of allowed values
-   DB:Reference, Taxon and GO ID columns are checked for minimal form
-   All IEAs over a year old are removed
-   Taxa with a 'representative' group (e.g. MGI for Mus musculus,
    FlyBase for Drosophila) must be submitted by that group only
