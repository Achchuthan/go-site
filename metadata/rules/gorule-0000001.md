The following basic checks ensure that submitted gene association files
conform to the GAF spec, and come from the original GAF check script.

-   Each line of the GAF file is checked for the correct number of
    columns, the cardinality of the columns, leading or trailing
    whitespace
-   Col 1 and all DB abbreviations must be in
    [GO.xrf\_abbs](http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/xrefs.cgi) (case
    may be incorrect)
-   All GO IDs must be extant in current ontology
-   Qualifier, evidence, aspect and DB object columns must be within the
    list of allowed values
-   DB:Reference, Taxon and GO ID columns are checked for minimal form
-   Date must be in YYYYMMDD format
-   All IEAs over a year old are removed
-   Taxa with a 'representative' group (e.g. MGI for Mus musculus,
    FlyBase for Drosophila) must be submitted by that group only
