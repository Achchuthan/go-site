The [No Data (ND) evidence
code](http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#nd) should be used
for annotations to the root nodes only and should be accompanied with
[GO\_REF:0000015](http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi#GO_REF:0000015)
or an internal reference. PMIDs **cannot** be used for annotations made
with ND.

-   if you are using an internal reference, that reference ID should be
    listed as an external accession for
    [GO\_REF:0000015](http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi#GO_REF:0000015).
    Please add (or email) your internal reference ID for
    GO\_REF:0000015.
-   All ND annotations made with a reference other than GO\_REF:0000015
    (or an equivalent internal reference that is listed as external
    accession for GO\_REF:0000015) should be filtered out of the GAF.

The SQL code identifies all ND annotations that do not use
GO\_REF:0000015 or one of the alternative internal references listed for
it in the [GO references
file](http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi).
