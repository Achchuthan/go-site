<p>The <a class="evCode" href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#nd">No Data (ND) evidence code</a> should be used for annotations to the root nodes only and should be accompanied with <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi#GO_REF:0000015">GO_REF:0000015</a> or an internal reference. PMIDs <strong>cannot</strong> be used for annotations made with <span class="evCode">ND</span>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
if you are using an internal reference, that reference ID should be listed as an external accession for <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi#GO_REF:0000015">GO_REF:0000015</a>. Please add (or email) your internal reference ID for GO_REF:0000015.
</li>
<li>
All <span class="evCode">ND</span> annotations made with a reference other than GO_REF:0000015 (or an equivalent internal reference that is listed as external accession for GO_REF:0000015) should be filtered out of the GAF.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The SQL code identifies all <span class="evCode">ND</span> annotations that do not use GO_REF:0000015 or one of the alternative internal references listed for it in the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/references.cgi">GO references file</a>.
