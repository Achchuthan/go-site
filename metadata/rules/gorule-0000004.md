<p>When annotating to terms that are descendants of protein binding, and when the curator can supply the accession of the interacting protein accession, it is essential that reciprocal annotations are available - i.e. if you say protein A binds protein B, then you need to also have the second annotation that states that protein B binds protein A.</p>
<p>This will be a soft QC; a script will make these inferences and it is up to each MOD to evaluate and include the inferences in their GAF/DB.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines">binding guidelines</a> on the GO wiki.</p>
